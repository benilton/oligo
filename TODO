oligo's TODO
- remove dependence on affxparser
- add dependence on affyio (much faster than affxparser)
- add examples, so package is tested whenever it's built and modifications do not break current code
- will need data pkgs (ie, with CEL/XYS files) and annotation pkg, so examples can be executed
- add the faster genotyping code for SNP 5.0/6.0
- add the CN tool
- make read.celfiles and read.xysfiles consistent
