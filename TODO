oligo's TODO
- Fix pmSequence() to use the new struct in the pdInfoBuilder pkg
- add examples, so package is tested whenever it's built and modifications do not break current code
- will need data pkgs (ie, with CEL/XYS files) and annotation pkg, so examples can be executed
- make read.celfiles and read.xysfiles consistent
