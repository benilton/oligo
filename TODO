- improve documentation
- add examples, so package is tested whenever it's built and modifications do not break current code
- will need data pkgs (ie, with CEL/XYS files) and annotation pkg, so examples can be executed
- add support for exon/rma and gene/rma (filtering + summarization)
- add scanDate to protocolData (check affy)
- fix functions for regular crlmm (there are instances of SnpQSet - replaced by AlleleSet - use bothStrands)
- add selectProbes
     by probeset name: include, exclude
     by type: pm/mm/bg/all
     selected fields: x/y/fid/fsetid/man_fsetid
- subset argument to methods to use selectProbes()
