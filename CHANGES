### CHANGE log for package oligo ###

12-8-2008: BC

** added binary snr file for 50k,250k arrays (crlmm)

** fixed pmPosition for NGS tiling

12-6-2008: BC

** read.celfiles was modified

** added: checkValidPhenodataForFiles, createPhenodataFromIds, createDefaultMiame, checkChipTypes
these helpers can (and will) be used for read.xysfiles

Changes made by Matt Settles 12-4-2008

** All changes should generally have effect on only Affy Tiling, ST and expression arrays.
modifed read.celfiles to appear more like read.affybatch, should present a noticable change

03-8-2009: BC

** Copied rma2.c from Affy... API for RMA changed.

** Added a basicRMA function in utils.R

** Added an rma method for Exon arrays.

** Changes previous rma method (originally for FeatureSet objs) to handle only ExpressionFeatureSet objects. The method is now in methods-ExpressionFeatureSet.R.

** RMA for Exon: we summarize to the probeset level. The output, an ExpressionSet, contains in its featureData slot annotation for further processing (to the exon/gene-level)

03-9-2009: BC - committed version 1.7.23

** Added support for Gene ST Arrays (structure very similar to Exon)

** Added RMA for Gene ST arrays. The only difference from RMA/Exon is the SQL query that includes an INNER JOIN to account for multiplicity (1:N mapping from probe to probeset). This is implemented in methods-GeneFeatureSet.R

03-17-2009: BC - committed version 1.7.25

** Modified rma method to extract information from pmfeature and bgfeature (bgfeature is assumed to contain PM probes only) tables. The qcpmfeature table will not be available for pdInfoBuilder objects on what I call 'version 2.0'.

03-24-2009: B Carvalho - committed versioin 1.7.29

** Several small changes to clean up package

** Added TilingFeatureSet2, read.xysfiles2, read.celfiles2, getNgsColorInfo as an attempt to appropriately handle two colors applications of tiling arrays.

03-25-2009: B Carvalho

** Changes to accommodate sequence methods

03-26-2009: B Carvalho

** Improved NAMESPACE

** Added basicRMA() to interface with RMA C-code

04-02-2009: B Carvalho

** Added affyio to parse CEL files. This is an initial attempt. 'affyio' provides a much faster parser and also allows users to read in CEL.gz files.

04-06-2009: B Carvalho

** list.celfiles() also returns .cel.gz files

04-07-2009: B Carvalho

** Cleaned up code.

04-13-2009: B Carvalho

** Changed read.table to read.delim in getCrlmmSummaries so filenames with white spaces do not break the code.

04-16-2009: B Carvalho

** Removed some unused code

04-24-2009: B Carvalho

** Added getContainer help page

** Added more verbosity to read.xysfiles

04-29-2009: B Carvalho

** Fixed documentation for read.celfiles and read.xysfiles

** Changed error message (when annotation cannot be loaded)

05-07-2009: B Carvalho

** Added C-code to parse XYS files

05-09-2009: B Carvalho

** Fixed sampleNames that was being ignored
