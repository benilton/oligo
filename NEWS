USER VISIBLE CHANGES

	o New vignette: Hands-On.

NEW FEATURES

	o Support to large datasets via ff package.
	The user should load the ff package in order to use
	this feature. Files used by ff are saved to getwd(),
	unless the user changes the standard path.

	o Support to parallel computing via snow package.
	The user should load *both* ff and snow in order to use
	the parallel features implemented in the package
	(backgroundCorrect, normalize, summarize, rma). Cluster
	variable should be set as options(cluster=makeCluster(...)).

	o seqColors and darkColors, respectively, generate a
	vector of sequential colors (in blue) and (qualitative)
	dark colors (based onn Dark2 from RColorBrewer).

	o plotM method for SnpSuperSet (plot genotype clusters).

	o getAffinitySplineCoefficients estimates the affinity
	spline coefficients.

	o getBaseProfile estimates and optionally plots sequence
	 effect like gcrma.
